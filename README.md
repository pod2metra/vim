# My VIM config

I am *python* developer and the most of tweeks are for web development and at most for *python*, but it is easy to add support for any other languages or to configure it for any other task.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git://github.com/satyrius/vim.git ~/.vim  # or clone your fork
cd ~/.vim && make
```

## Plug

I use [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for Vim plugins management, because I found it better that other common solutions. The most important for me is that it allow you to freeze plugin version.

## .vimrc

My *.vimrc* contains basic *Vim* settings which can be applied to any language. All settings are grouped in a folded sections and has comments, so you can undestand why I use them. It also contain common plugin bundles. Navigation plugins are the most important, in my opinion, espetially when you work on the project, not a single script. My favorites are:

* [Ctrl-P](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3736) is a fuzzy finder written in pure Vimscript;
* With [Buffer Explorer](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=42) you can quickly and easily switch between buffers, you will love it if you prefer work with buffers instead of tabs;
* [NERDTree](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658) allows you to explore your filesystem and to open files and
directories. It presents the filesystem to you in the form of a tree which you
manipulate with the keyboard and/or mouse. It also allows you to perform
simple filesystem operations.


## vimrc.d

I have *vimrc.d* drectory. It contains additional vim settings files. I use it to keep main *.vimrc* as small as it is possible, to make it clear and easy to undestand *Vim* configuring basics. *vimrc.d* settings are mostly for specific languages (e.g. *Python*, *JavaScript*) and tasks. I do not want to move this settings to *plugin* or *ftplugin* because they have *bundles* definition and should be in the middle of *.vimrc* (see *bundle* section for details).

### Python

As I said above, I am a *Python* developer, so the most advanced settings are for *Python* and they are in *vimrc.d/python.vim*. All major python plugins require *Vim* to be compiled with python support. Check is your *Vim* supports python

```bash
vim --version | grep +python
```

If it does not, you should build you own *with blackjack and hookers*. ~~In fact, forget the Vim!~~ Here is [the recipe](https://gist.github.com/satyrius/1635076) how to do it under *Mac OS X*. After you get the python and vim with python, you should install a few python modules (do it for the python you use in `--with-python-config-dir`, it is usual a system wide python)

```bash
pip install jedi
pip install flake8
```

My vim settings are smart enouth to undestand is your *Vim* satisfies all requerements for each python plugin, so it checks for `has('python')` and for python modules installed. It also activates the proper virtualenv for you. The most helpful python plugins are

* [jedi-vim](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim) â€“ awesome Python autocompletion;
* [Flake8](https://github.com/nvie/vim-flake8) allow to run flake8 on python files;

### Go

The *Go* development plugin I use is *Blackrush/vim-gocode*. It is bundled with standard `$GOROOT/misc/vim` stuff plus [gocode](https://github.com/nsf/gocode) autocompetion. It has some requirements for [Mac OS X installation](https://github.com/Blackrush/vim-gocode/wiki/Installation-on-OS-X) and of course you need *gocode* to be installed. For *go to definition* feature I use *dgryski/vim-godef*. Breafly you should do the following.

```bash
brew install coreutils
ln -s /usr/local/bin/greadlink /usr/local/bin/readlink
# Ensure your GOPATH and PATH are ok then
go get -u github.com/nsf/gocode
go get -v code.google.com/p/rog-go/exp/cmd/godef
go install -v code.google.com/p/rog-go/exp/cmd/godef
```

### C sharp

*nosami/Omnisharp* is a plugin for Vim to provide IDE like abilities for *C#*. It has tons of features including code completion, go to definition, code formatter and many other. To make it work you should install *Mono* first, then build the plugin.

```bash
make csharp
```

## local .vimrc

You alway want to add some tiny tweeks for each you project, but cannot add them to the main *.vimrc*, because it should not affect other projects. Fortunately *Vim* allows you to use local (a.k.a per directory) settings. You can see the following at the end of my *.vimrc*

```vim
set exrc
set secure
```

Now you can create *.vimrc* in your projects root, change working dir to it, and open *Vim* with *common + local* settings.

## Conclusion

VIM or DIE!
